# ** Handling Minor and Major Upgrades in NetBSD
** [[https:./articles-netbsd-backup/][Backup and restore in NetBSD]]
Putting together the bits and pieces of a backup and restore concept,
while not being rocket science, always seems to be a little bit
ungrateful. Most Admin Handbooks handle this topic only within few
pages. After replacing my old Mac Mini's OS by NetBSD, I tried to
implement an automated backup, allowing me to handle it similarly to
the time machine backups I've been using before.

** [[https:./articles-netbsd-install/][Experiences Installing NetBSD on a PPC based Mac Mini]]
Over the easter days I was planning to resurrect my trusty ppc based Mac Mini and
to replace the old OSX 10.4 with a newer, but still BSD-based operating system.
Unfortunately, as it seems, there are a few obstacles to
overcome when trying to install NetBSD/macppc on a Mac Mini. So
I thought I'd write a little bit about my experiences in case someone else
(probably me) ever tries to install this combination again.

** [[https://github.com/e17i/emacs-config/][My Emacs babel-init.org]]
Programming Lisp can be very recreational. And one of the best places
to do that these days is in Emacs. So here is my literate emacs init,
consisting of all kinds of collected lisp functions. Some of them
probably should be put into proper packages instead...

# * NetBSD
# * Emacs
# * TeX
# * Oberon
# * Programming in general
