* Whats this?
Here I'm planning to subsequently write about topics of my personal
interest and to put in some of the notes I made over the years.
For now, there is:

* NetBSD

** [[https:./articles-netbsd-install/][Experiences Installing NetBSD on a PPC based Mac Mini]]
** [[https:./articles-netbsd-backup/][Backup and restore in NetBSD]]
# ** Handling Minor and Major Upgrades in NetBSD

* Emacs

** [[https:./emacs-config/][My babel-init.org]]

# * TeX

# * Oberon

# * Programming in general
